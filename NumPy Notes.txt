Numpy
Numpy is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on Numpy as one of their main building blocks
Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. 

For Installing

pip install numpy

NumPy arrays essentially comes in two flavors: vectors and matrices
